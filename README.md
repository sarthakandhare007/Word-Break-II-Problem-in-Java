Problem Statement

Given a string s and a dictionary of words wordDict, add spaces in s to construct all possible sentences such that every word is a valid word in wordDict.
Return all such possible sentences in any order.

üîπ Example 1:

Input:

s = "catsanddog"
wordDict = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"]

Output:

["cats and dog", "cat sand dog"]

üîπ Example 2:

Input:

s = "pineapplepenapple"
wordDict = ["apple","pen","applepen","pine","pineapple"]

Output:

["pine apple pen apple",
 "pineapple pen apple",
 "pine applepen apple"]

‚öôÔ∏è Approach (Explanation)

This is a backtracking + memoization (DP) problem.

1. We recursively try to break the string at every possible point.


2. If a substring exists in the dictionary, we recursively solve for the remaining part.


3. To avoid re-computation, we store results of subproblems in a HashMap (memoization).


4. Finally, we join all combinations that form valid sentences.
